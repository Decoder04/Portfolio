INFO:root:Session ID: 740ea7aa-8e3c-49f1-ad7c-2fbeaf338997, AI Response: The core framework for logical thinking involves three main components:

1. **Summarising (What's your point?)**: This involves distilling information to its essence, clearly defining the main point or message that needs to be conveyed. It requires identifying key ideas and expressing them in a concise manner.

2. **Reasoning (Why?)**: This component is about providing justification or rationale behind an idea, argument, or decision. It involves explaining the logic and reasoning that support the main point, often through evidence, examples, or analysis.

3. **Covering (Is that all?)**: This involves ensuring that all necessary aspects of a topic or argument have been considered and addressed. It requires comprehensive thinking to include all relevant information and anticipate potential questions or objections.

These components work together to structure thoughts in a coherent manner, making arguments clear, justified, and thorough.
